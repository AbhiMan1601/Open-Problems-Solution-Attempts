# Open-Problems-Solution-Attempts
This repo contains my exposition and comments into open Mathematical and Statistical Problems (usually checked by faculty members of my university or/and my peers) and I hope to get something worthwhile for publishing as well.
Help with the solutions + alternate solutions + pointing out of mistakes will be appreciated.
